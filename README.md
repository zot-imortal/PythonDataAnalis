Analisis  data from solar panels  Switzerland University
This project aims to collect and analyze extensive statistics on solar panels, their performance and environmental impact.

Main goals of the project:

Collection and analysis of statistical data: We will collect and process information about solar panels installed in different regions of the world. This includes data on the power of installed systems, solar activity levels, climate conditions and other factors affecting the efficiency of solar panels.

Efficiency Assessment: Our team will analyze the data obtained to determine the efficiency of solar panels in different regions. We will identify best practices and factors that influence the optimal use of solar systems.

Environmental Assessment: We will also evaluate the environmental aspects of using solar panels, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, reduced dependence on fossil fuels and other benefits compared to traditional energy sources.

Development of recommendations: Based on our research, we will develop recommendations for the optimal installation and operation of solar panels in different regions and conditions.

Public Education: We plan to disseminate our research and recommendations to increase awareness of the use of solar panels and their benefits to the environment.

This project was created to support the transition to greener and more efficient energy sources and promote sustainable development. We invite researchers, ecologists, engineers and anyone interested in energy efficiency to join our team and contribute to achieving these goals.
